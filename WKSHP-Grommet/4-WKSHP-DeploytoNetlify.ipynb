    "## Lab 4: Deploy your App to Netlify\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will drive you through the following steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sign up for a Netlify account using GitHub account\n",
    "- Link your GitHub repository to Netlify\n",
    "- Edit deployment settings\n",
    "- Deploy your application on the internet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Netlify?\n",
    "Netlify is simply used for hosting static sites. Another alternative to static site hosting is GitHub pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Netlify allows user to generate a custom URL for a project under Netlify.app domain name e.g `studentxxx.netlify.app`\n",
    "- It is possible to connect own custom domain e.g `mywebsite.com`, set up a CNAME, and A-Records on Netlify. More information from [Netlify website](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/26/how-to-set-up-netlify-dns-custom-domains-cname-and-a-records/)\n",
    "- It is possible to drag and drop a folder containing project HTML, CSS, JS into Netlify for manual deployment using Netlify drop (screenshot below).\n",
    "- For automatic deployment, a user can connect a GitHub repository to Netlify and have it automatically trigger new deployments with new repository commits in a continuous integration approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signup\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign up for [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/login) account using your GitHub account\n",

    "After you sign up, you will be redirected to Netlify account site section.\n",

    "### Link your GitHub repository to netlify\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on New site from git to link your GitHub repository to netlify\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us proceed with New Site from GitHub option\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the Git provider where your siteâ€™s source code is hosted and select the repository to grant access to netlify.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Deployed Netlify site link](Pictures/netlify-deployed-site-link.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, auto publish will be turned on, if you make any changes to your GitHub source code, netlify will auto deploy your site.\n",
