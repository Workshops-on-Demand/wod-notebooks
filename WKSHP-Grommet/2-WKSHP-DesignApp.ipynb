    "- Design your profile card using [Grommet Designer](https://designer.grommet.io/)\n",
    "- Publish your design\n",
    "- Share your design for feedback\n",
    "- Generate the code from design\n",

    "**NOTE**: If you have any difficulty in designing your app by following below steps, you can directly download the source code from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sulaymon333/studentxxx) and proceed to [Lab 3](3-WKSHP-PrepareEnvironment.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, open a browser, preferably chrome in your laptop, and open the [Grommet Designer](https://designer.grommet.io/) site to start your design.\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, the grommet theme will be selected in the designer.grommet.io, and you will see all your buttons, links etc in violet color. To select a different theme, click on your design name \"StudentXXX\", click on Configure, a pop up window will show. Under theme, select `grommet` for example. You will notice that the overall app theme and color has changed from green to violet. Select `hpe` theme again and close the pop window. \n",
