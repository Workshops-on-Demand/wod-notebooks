    "The HPE DEV Team have been working for more than a year on developing workshops for physical events, then for virtual events and finally for [Workshops-on-Demand](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops).\n",
    "This tutorial is a guide for those who would be willing to leverage our experience to develop some new content . it will cover the basics of a jupyter notebook technologies. It should also learn you how to install the necessary tooling to develop on your own laptop.\n",

    "You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). \n",

    "## Lab flow\n",
    "HackShack Workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook is a series de cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To Run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",
