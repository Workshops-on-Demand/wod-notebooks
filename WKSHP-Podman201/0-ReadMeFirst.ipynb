    "# Introduction to Podman 201\n",
    "In this workshop, we’ll explain and use some deeper concepts of how Podman works, going deeper into networking, storage and security. We will also explain how Podman can be used as development and / or test environments for workloads that then will be deployed into a kubernetes cluster. We will use OpenShift which is Red Hat's kubernetes based container and app-dev platform.\n",
    "Remember to go through the [Podman 101](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshop/46) workshop to understand the basic concepts that we'll use during this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is intended to support a trial and error method so that, during the session, students should fully understand concepts and functionallity of the tool. Blindly following instructions is not an effective way to learn, IMHO. You've been warned ;-)\n",

    "This workshop is intended to be an introduction to advanced concepts of Podman, for a detailed explanation on the functionality please use [Podman documentation]( https://docs.podman.io)\n",

    "## Handouts\n",
    "You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). \n",
    "- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of the Podman Lab\n",
    "At the end of the lab, students should be able to manage Podman networks, volumes, pods and Quadlets. Students should also learn the core concepts used for deploying applications to kubernetes and understand how Podman and kubernetes integrate with each other.\n",

    "Also, for the OpenShift cluster you can review it's documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform\n",

    "## Lab flow\n",
    "The {{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files, which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• A cell can be markdown or code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To run a cell, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running, it displays a [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy the labs ! :-)\n",
