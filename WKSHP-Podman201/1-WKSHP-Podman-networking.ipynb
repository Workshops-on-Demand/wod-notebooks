    "Podman uses the default network \"podman\" for all containers unless specified differently. If no other network is set all containers will be able to communicate with each other throught this network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, there are scenarios in which you may want to create a separate network for a set of containers. For example, if you have a three tier application with a frontend, backend and database. In this scenario you want the frontend to communicate with the backend but not with your database container directly as it will be using the backend for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve that you can create a \"front\" and a \"back\" network, attach the frontend and the backend container to the \"front\" network and attach the backend and the database containers to the \"back\" network. With this setup the backend container will be able to communicate with the frontend and the database as it's attached to both networks, but the fronend and database containers wont see each other.\n",
