    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class** - Collection of objects that contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created\n",
    "* **Objects** - Entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.\n",
    "* **Attritubes** - Attributes are the characteristics of an object. They are stored as variables within a class and represent the state of the object.\n",
    "* **Methods** - Methods are functions defined within the scope of a class. They define the behavior of the objects created from that class."
