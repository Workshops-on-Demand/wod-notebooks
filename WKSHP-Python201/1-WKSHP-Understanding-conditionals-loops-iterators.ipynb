    "- The `divide_numbers` function checks if the second argument (`b`) is zero.\n",
    "- If `b` is zero, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` with a custom error message.\n",

    "- The `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints the error message.\n",
    "- The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n"

    "2. Within the function, raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty.\n",
