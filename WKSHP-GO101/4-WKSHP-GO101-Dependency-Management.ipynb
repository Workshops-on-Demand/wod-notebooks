Many vulnerabilities can be introduced by outdated third-party libraries, and these are often patched in newer versions. Using `go get` to update your dependencies ensures you're benefiting from the latest security fixes.\n",

    "- **Run `go get` Regularly**: Periodically running `go get -u` ensures that you pull in the latest stable updates for your dependencies, minimizing security risks.\n",
    "- **Monitor Vulnerabilities**: Keep track of security advisories related to your dependencies. Tools like [GoSec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) can help you analyze your code and its dependencies for security issues.\n",
    "- **Locking Dependencies**: Always specify exact versions for critical dependencies in the `go.mod` file to prevent accidental upgrades that could introduce breaking changes or vulnerabilities."
