    "# Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency refers to a programming language's ability to deal with a lot of things at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to understand concurrency is by imagining multiple cars traveling on two lanes. Sometimes the cars overtake each other, and sometimes they stop and let others pass by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good example is when your computer runs multiple background tasks like messaging, downloading movies, running the operating system, and so on – all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism means doing a lot of things simultaneously and independently. It might sound similar to concurrency, but it’s actually quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand it better with the same traffic example. In this case, cars travel on their own road without intersecting each other. Each task is isolated from all other tasks. Different from concurrent tasks can be executed in any given order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a non-deterministic way to achieve multiple things at once. True parallel events require multiple CPUs.\n",

    "## What are Channels?\n",
    "In concurrent programming, Go provides channels that you can use for bidirectional communication between goroutines.\n",

    "Bidirectional communication means that one goroutine will send a message and the other will read it. Sends and receives are blocking. Code execution will be stopped until the write and read are done successfully.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a couple different types of channels:\n",

    "Unbuffered channel: Unbuffered channels require both the sender and receiver to be present to be successful operations. It requires a goroutine to read the data, otherwise, it will lead to deadlock. By default, channels are unbuffered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buffered channel: Buffered channels have the capacity to store values for future processing. The sender is not blocked until it becomes full and it doesn't necessarily need a reader to complete the synchronization with every operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a space in the array is available, the sender can send its value to the channel and complete its send operation immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "After its execution, if a receiver comes, the channel will start sending values to the receiver and it will start its operation once it receives the values. As the sender and receiver are operating at different times, this is called asynchronous communication.\n"
