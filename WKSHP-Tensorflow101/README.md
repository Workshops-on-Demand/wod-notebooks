# WoD Developer Workshop



# Introduction to TensorFlow Library 101
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working within the Machine Intelligence team at Google Brain to conduct research in machine learning and neural networks. However, the framework is versatile enough to be used in other areas as well.

TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as a non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages.

## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
WoD Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series de cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

### Pre-requisites

You should have basic Python knowledge and be familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks.  If not, the following free hands-on workshops are recommended:

 - [Python 101](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/15)
 - [Jupyter Notebooks 101](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/25)
 
 If you are completely new to machine learning, the following free course is recommended to understand the concepts:
 
 - [Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Concepts](https://learn.ezmeral.software.hpe.com/page/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning)



Enjoy the labs ! :-)

## Workflow

### Lab 1: TensorFlow Basics.
Description: In this section, we’ll go through some of basics of TensorFlow. You won't turn into a data scientist just yet but you should understand better some of the main principles after this workshop.
