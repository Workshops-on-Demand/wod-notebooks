    "To facilitate the usage of the API from various programming languages and to avoid creating code to build HTTP requests and all their attributes (headers, body), we have libraries for several languages that will take care of REST details and let you concentrate on the resources you want to manage. In this workshop we are going to use PowerShell. Version 5.0 (and later) of the HPE OneView PowerShell library is compatible with [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and can work on different platforms, Windows of course, but also macOS and Linux.  \n",

It is important to understand that without an X-API-Version header in the request, OneView will assume you want the oldest version of the API it can support. Let's take an example with a feature that was added relatively recently in OneView, hypervisor cluster profiles. What happens if you try a GET on that resource without an X-API-Version header ?"
