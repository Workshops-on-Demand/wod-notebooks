    "In this workshop we’ll go through some of basics concepts aroud Data Visualization: \n",
    "Data Visualization: It is the process of translating large data sets into charts, maps, graphs, and other visuals. The main purpose of data visualization is to visualize data by representing it in pictorial form. It helps data scientists to understand the data and how to solve the problem and represent it for providing recommendations.\n",
    "Data visualization is important as it discovers the trends in data. It gives a clear idea of what information means by presenting it in the form of visuals like graphs, charts, maps, etc. This makes data more comprehensible for the human mind and as a result, makes it easier to identify patterns in large datasets.\n",

    "You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). \n",

    "## Lab flow\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook is a series de cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To Run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have basic Python knowledge and be familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks.  If not, the following free hands-on workshops are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Python 101](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/15)\n",
    " - [Jupyter Notebooks 101](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/25)\n",
    " \n",
    " If you are completely new to machine learning, the following free course is recommended to understand the concepts:\n",
