    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook is a series de cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To Run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",
