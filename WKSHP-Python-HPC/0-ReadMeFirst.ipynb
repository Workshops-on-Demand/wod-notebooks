    "- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)\n",
    "- A previous Workshop-on-Demand introducing Jupyter is available [here](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/25)\n",
    "- For real beginners, there is also a [Python 101 {{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshop-on-Demand](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshop/15) available from [here](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/15)\n",

    "## Lab flow\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the training environment, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",

    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To Run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the \"stop\" button.\n",
