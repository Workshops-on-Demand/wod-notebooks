    "In this workshop, you obtained a practical experience with different methods to use Ansible for Redfish management tasks in an HPE Synergy and HPE OneView environment. The first method was with the Ansible built-in `uri` method and the second with the HPE iLOrest library. Then, you had an overview of the Ansible Galaxy collection and its three Redfish modules. The last method used the Ansible `Shell` module calling the [HPE iLOrest tool](http://hpe.com/info/resttool).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of notebooks 2,3 and 4, you validated the portability of the code against two different types of servers (Synergy and rack-mount).\n",

    "**Congratulations!**\n"
