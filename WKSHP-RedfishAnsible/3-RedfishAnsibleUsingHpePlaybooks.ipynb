    "The HPE Ansible Redfish [Gitub repository](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role) proposes three sets of Ansible Redfish Playbooks examples using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * the [iLOrest tool](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role/tree/master/iloresttool_playbooks)\n",
    "  * the Ansible Redfish Galaxy [collection](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role/tree/master/ansibleredfish_playbooks)\n",
    "  * [Ansible modules](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role/tree/master/library) derived from the [examples](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-ilorest-library/tree/master/examples/Redfish) in the `python-ilorest-library`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, you will study a [Redfish Ansible Playbook](3/SetIndicatorLEDUsingiLOrestLibrary.yml) based upon the [set_uid_light.py](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-ilorest-library/tree/master/examples/Redfish/set_uid_light.py) example of the the HPE [python-ilorest-library](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-ilorest-library/tree/master/). This Python example has been modified to become an Ansible module similar (but slightly differently) to the one in the [HPE GitHub site](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role/blob/master/library/set_uid_light.py). \n",

    "In this workshop, you used an Ansible Python module containing calls to the HPE `python-ilorest-library` to get and set the same Redfish resources as in the previous notebook. The advantage of this method is to move the complexity of crawling the Redfish tree from the playbook into the Python module and the use of the HPE Python Redfish library. This allows you to use the power and flexibility of the Python language in terms of authentication, data manipulation and error handling. You validated the same code against three different types of servers, proving its portability (Synergy compute, ProLiant DL360g10 and HPE Superdome Flex).\n",
