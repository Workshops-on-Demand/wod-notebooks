    "  * [Redfish command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/redfish_command_module.html) - Performs `set` operations on log management, user management, and power operations (e.g. on, off, reboot, etc.). The exhaustive list of possible commands is in the `CATEGORY_COMMANDS_ALL` array in the [module sources](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/main/plugins/modules/remote_management/redfish/redfish_command.py). \n",
