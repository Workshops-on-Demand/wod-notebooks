    "This notebook invokes a playbook that uses the [Ansible Shell](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html) built-in module to launch the HPE [iLOrest](http://hpe.com/info/resttool) Command Line Interface (CLI) to get and set the chassis [Unit Identification light](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/ilo-rest-api-docs/ilo5/#indicatorled) (UID) status of two HPE iLO 5 based servers: an HPE Synergy compute and a rack server. The content of the [Ansible Playbook](5/SetIndicatorLEDUsingIlorest.yml) used in this notebook is derived from the examples present in the [ansible-ilorest-role](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role/tree/master/iloresttool_playbooks) HPE GitHub.\n"

    "### Cache considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to increase performance, the iLOrest tool uses a cache directory to store various data specific to managed servers. This cache directory is created during the authentication process in a default location unless a specific location is specified on the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Ansible can run a given task in parrallel on several hosts, you must specify a dedicated cache directory for each host. If you don't specify a dedicated cache for each host, the default cache directory will be overwritten by each new connection and, only the last host will be able to complete the task with a valid cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the (`host, cache`) tuple coherent, your cache directory name will use a combination of the IP address of the global iLO5 simulator server and the specific TCP port number of your private simulators (`SimulIP:SimulPort`). \n",
    "\n",
    "A generic Ansible `cache_dir` variable is created in the `hosts` inventory file populated on the fly in the Environment Preparation cell of this notebook. This variable is used in the [Ansible Playbook](5/SetIndicatorLEDUsingIlorest.yml). \n"

    "### Authentication considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "As iLOrest does not support the OneView Single Sign On (SSO) we are not able to use the token obtained in the first notebook of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the `ilorest` login process is commented out, in the [Ansible Playbook](5/SetIndicatorLEDUsingIlorest.yml) because the iLO 5 simulators do not support any authentication process. Skipping the iLOrest authentication process also means that the cache directory is not populated. To overcome this, your environment holds compressed cache files (one per simulator) that are uncompressed in the right location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ilorest logout` process is also commented out in this [Ansible Playbook](5/SetIndicatorLEDUsingIlorest.yml), in case you want to run multiple times the playbook. The reason is because an `ilorest logout` command triggers a complete deletion of the cache directory, which would prevent you to re-run the playbook again without playing the Environment Preparation cell."
