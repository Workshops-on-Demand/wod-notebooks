    "This notebook uses the [HPE OneView Ansible Galaxy collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/hpe/oneview) to connect to a OneView appliance, get a server that is managed by this appliance and get a security token for that server's iLO. This token will be used in subsquent sections of the lab to connect to the iLO without authenticating again, using the Single Sign On (SSO) feature of OneView and iLO.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, for the sake of transparency, the unabated truth for this lab is that you will be using simulated hardware. You are going to connect to a OneView appliance that contains code that simulates responses from managed hardware. While these simulated responses do allow getting an iLO security token, they do not fully simulate an iLO. So in subsequent sections of this lab, you will be using another simulator that fully implements the Redfish API like an iLO. The 2 simulators are independent of each other, in other words the token you are going to obtain in this section cannot really be used in the following sections. You will just have to trust us that it really works this way with real hardware. Yes, we've tested it !"
