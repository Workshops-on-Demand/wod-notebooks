    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the [HPE OneView Ansible Galaxy collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/hpe/oneview) to connect to an HPE OneView appliance, retrieves properties of a server that is managed by this appliance as well as a security token for that server's iLO. This token will be used in subsequent sections of the lab to connect to the iLO without authenticating again, using the Single Sign On (SSO) feature of HPE OneView and iLO.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of transparency, the unabated truth regarding this lab is that you will be using simulated hardware. You are going to connect to an HPE OneView appliance containing code that simulates responses from managed hardware. While these simulated responses allow one to obtain an iLO security token, they do not fully simulate an iLO. So, in subsequent sections of this lab, you will be using another simulator that fully implements the Redfish API like an iLO. The two simulators are independent of each other. In other words the token you are going to obtain in this section cannot be used in the following sections. You will just have to trust us that it really works this way with real hardware. Yes, we've tested it!\n",

    ">NOTE: At the time of the writing, OneView does not support SSO against Superdome Flex servers. Hence, this notebook is valid for iLO 5 based servers only."
