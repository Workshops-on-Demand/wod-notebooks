# HPE Developer Workshop



# Introduction to GIT 101 Understand GIT well enough to join the open source community!
In this workshop, you’ll learn how to master basic Git concepts that will allow you to become members of the open source community. This workshop covers real-life use cases.

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to master basic Git concepts that will allow you to become members of the open source community. This workshop covers real-life use cases, including scenarios covering the following:
 
1. I’d like to use something from the community
2. I'd like to report an issue on a repository
3. I'd like to share something with the community
4. I'd like to contribute code to a repository

You do not need to be a developer to participate and you will not need to write any code. Instead, we will use bash scripting to learn Git through its Command Line Interface (CLI).


# Lab Flow

HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always ends in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the terminal sessions, this year, we decided to innovate and introduce a brand new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different labs guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb). 

However, the notebooks can be downloaded on to your own laptop for further use or edits. In order to use  them, you will need to install the Jupyter Notebook application available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series of cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button


Happy labs ! :-)


## Handouts

You can freely copy the Jupyter notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.

## Workflow

There is only one lab in this worskhop: 

# Lab 1: Understand GIT well enough to join the open source community!
