    "HackShack Labs and Open labs are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always ends in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the terminal sessions, this year, we decided to innovate and introduce a brand new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different labs guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the notebooks can be downloaded on to your own laptop for further use or edits. In order to use  them, you will need to install the Jupyter Notebook application available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",

    "Now, please listen to the instructor guidelines on how to use Jupyter Notebooks and follow along as he goes through the different steps.\n",

    "You can freely copy the Jupyter notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
