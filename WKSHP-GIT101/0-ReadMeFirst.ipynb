    "# Lab Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always ends in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the terminal sessions, this year, we decided to innovate and introduce a brand new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different labs guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the notebooks can be downloaded on to your own laptop for further use or edits. In order to use  them, you will need to install the Jupyter Notebook application available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To Run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy labs ! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handouts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can freely copy the Jupyter notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
