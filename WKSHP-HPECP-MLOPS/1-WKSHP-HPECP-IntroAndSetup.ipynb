        "- **HPE Ezmeral Container Platform** is an enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications whether on-premises, at the edge, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model. This makes the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform ideal for helping enterprise customers accelerate their application development and deployment on containers, on-demand through a self-service portal and a RESTful API that surfaces programmable access. To learn more about HPE Ezmeral Container Platform visit the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com) and check out the blog articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tenant:** A tenant is a group of users created by the platform administrator. A tenant can represent for example, an office location, a business unit, an organization, or a project. A tenant is allocated a quota of resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) by the platform administrator. The resources used by a tenant are private to the tenant, other tenants have no visibility. A tenant user is granted the role of member or admin for the tenant.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **HPE Ezmeral ML Ops** HPE Ezmeral Machine Learning (ML) Ops brings the power of containers to the entire ML lifecycle to enable users to build, train, share, deploy, and monitor ML models. See [HPE Ezmeral ML Ops](http://docs.bluedata.com/51_about-hpe-ml-ops). To enable sharing model and data artifacts, ML Ops integrates tenant-private persistent data store for Project repository when a AI/ML tenant is created. \n",
