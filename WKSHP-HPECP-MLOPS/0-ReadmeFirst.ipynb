        "HPE Ezmeral Container Platform (HPE ECP) uses container technology to make it simpler and more cost-effective to deploy, run and manage both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications for machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "HPE Ezmeral Machine Learning (ML) Ops extends the speed and agility of HPE ECP by bringing the power of containers to the entire ML lifecycle to enable users to build, train, share, deploy, and monitor ML models. Ezmeral ML Ops supports sandbox development (notebooks), distributed training, and the deployment and monitoring of trained models in production. To enable sharing model and data artifacts, Ezmeral ML Ops integrates Project repository, source control, and model registry capabilities.\n",

        "You will get started with some fundamental knowledge about how to interact with the HPE ECP control plane UI. We walk you, a tenant/project user, through step by step details to build, train, register and deploy the model. At the end of the session, you will be able to test model serving.\n",

Containerized application service endpoints are exposed from HPE ECP to users via the gateway re-mapped ports. \n",
