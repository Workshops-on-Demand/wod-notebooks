    "## Overview\n",
    "In this workshop weâ€™ll go through some of basics concepts aroud Apache Spark.\n",
    "Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for incremental computation and stream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "the following lab could run from your laptop or from binder but we adapted it to fit in our overall workshop infrastructure.\n",
    "We are using a vm appliance serving one docker container (containing the labs) per student.\n",
    "\n",

    "The workshop is leveraging a docker image providing all the necessary tooling for this lab : \n",
    "here is a link to the [Jupyter Notebook Scientific Python Stack  docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook) \n",
    "\n",
    "you will be moving to a second jupyter notebook environment right now using the link provided below."
