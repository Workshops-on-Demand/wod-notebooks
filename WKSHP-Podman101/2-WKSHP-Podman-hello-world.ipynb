    "Just like any other container engine, Podman has the ability to manage and execute container images. A container image is a static image that contains an applications with all it's dependencies. Because the dependencies are included within the container image we can expect the same application behaviour if it's executed in different hosts, solving one of the most widespread problems for developers: \"it worked in my environment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Container images are stored in container registries, by default Podman will look for container images in quay.io, registry.redhat.io and docker.io. You can configure additional registries by modifying the file /etc/containers/registries.conf, we'll not cover this advanced configuration during this workshop.\n",

There are several ways you can do this, one of the most common is to run the container interactively. You will need to add two options for this purpose, first one is the \"--tty\" that will allocate a pseudo-TTY for the container; the second is \"--interactive\" which will keep STDIN open even if not attached. We can combine both options just by using the \"-it\" option.\n",
