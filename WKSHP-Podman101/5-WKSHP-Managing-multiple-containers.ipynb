    "# Managing multiple containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a single container with podman is just fine, we have demonstrated how simple it is througout this workshop. But, what happens if I want to run multiple containers simultaneously? Do you need to execute them one by one?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the tool podman compose to execute multiple containers in a single command. Podman compose is a tool that helps you defining the list of containers and all of their configuration in a text file written in yaml format. Then you can choose to execute, stop, remove, update all of the containers defined in the file at once. Podman compose is a very powerful tool but it's limited to execute on a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets run a basic example of podman-compose. First we are going to build two container images, one of them will be an nginx proxy that will be exposed through a port of our host and the second one will be simulating a backend. The backend is just an httpd server showing the message \"I'm the backend\", but what we want to demonstrate here is how to deploy multi-tier applications and that is why the nginx-proxy will be acting as a front-end redirecting all the traffic in a specific location to the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by building our backend container image. As we have seen in the section two of this workshop we will need a Containerfile and an index.html file. First we will create the Containerfile:"
