# HPE Developer Workshop



# Introduction to Rust Programming language
In this workshop, we will introduce the audience to Rust programming. This will be a hands-on session based on Jupyter Notebooks. We will also discuss lessons learn within the 3PAR/Primera team.

# Author: [Jonthan Parris](mailto:jonathan.parris@hpe.com)  & [Malachi Thomas](mailto:malachi.thomas@hpe.com)

## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series de cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)


## Workflow

### Lab 1: Lab 1 Introduction to RUST
Description: In this section, we’ll go through some of the fundamentals of Rust programming language.A simple 101 of the language and a few lessons learnt from our experience.
