    "## How Do LLMs Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT use a type of neural network architecture called a **Transformer** to predict the next word in a sentence. Let's break down the process into three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Text Tokenization and Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization:** The input text (a sentence or a paragraph) is split into smaller parts called **tokens**. Tokens can be whole words or subwords. For example, \"chatbot\" might be split into [\"chat\", \"bot\"].\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Embeddings:** Each token is then converted into a numerical format called an **embedding** — a vector of numbers that represents the token in a multi-dimensional space. In this space, tokens with similar meanings are positioned closer together. Think of it like placing words on a map, where words with related meanings are grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture consists of several layers that help the model understand the context and relationships between tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** This is like a spotlight that the model uses to focus on different parts of the input text. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat,\" the model learns that \"cat\" and \"sat\" are related. Self-attention helps the model determine which words are important and how they relate to each other within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedforward Layers:** After determining the importance and relationships of words through self-attention, the model uses a series of mathematical operations (feedforward layers) to process this information further. These layers help the model refine its understanding and make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Predicting the Next Word\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Softmax Layer:** At the end of the Transformer model, there is a special layer called the **Softmax layer**. It calculates the probabilities of all possible words that could come next in the sentence. The word with the highest probability is the most likely next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoregressive Generation:** The model then selects the word with the highest probability and adds it to the sequence of words. It repeats this process for each new word, using the updated sequence each time to predict the next word until it completes the sentence or reaches a specified length.\n",
