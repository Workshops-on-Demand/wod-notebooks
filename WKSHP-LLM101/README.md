## Workshops on Demand

## Introduction to Understanding LLM basics and the value they provide

In this workshop, we'll explore the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)—their definition, structure, and practical usage—using real examples demonstrated with HPE's open-source library, LL-Mesh.

## Author: [Antonio Fin](mailto:antonio.fin@hpe.com)

### Handouts

You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.

- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)

### Lab flow

HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series de cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)

### Workflow

### Lab 1: LLM Basics

Description: In this section, we'll explore the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)—their definition, structure, and practical usage—using real examples demonstrated with HPE's open-source library, LL-Mesh.

- [Lab 1](1-WKSHP-LLM_Basics.ipynb)

### Lab 2: LL-Mesh Overview

**Description:** In this lab, we'll explore the challenges of adopting Generative AI technologies and discuss how the LL-Mesh platform provides effective solutions to overcome them.

- [Lab 2](2-WKSHP-LLMesh_Overview.ipynb)

### Lab 3: Building a Chatbot with LL-Mesh

**Description:** In this lab, we'll provide examples of creating a chat application by concatenating prompts, models, and memories using LL-Mesh.

- [Lab 3](3-WKSHP-LLM_Chat.ipynb)

### Lab 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Description:** This lab offers examples of a RAG application, starting from extracting data from a document, transforming it, and loading it into a vector store for retrieval.

- [Lab 4](4-WKSHP-LLM_RAG.ipynb)

### Lab 5: Multi-Agent Systems

**Description:** Explore the concept of multi-agent systems and how they can be implemented using LL-Mesh.

- [Lab 5](5-WKSHP-LLM_Agents.ipynb)

### Lab 5: LL-Mesh Web Apps Showcase

**Description:** This lab showcases some example web applications that are available in the LL-Mesh repository.

- [Lab 6](6-WKSHP-LLM_WebApps.ipynb)
