    "You are welcome to copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their outputs, to practice at your own pace back at your office using a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",
    "- A beginner's guide is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Flow\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a centralized platform that provides a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Instead of using standard PDF filesâ€”which often lead to copy/paste errors during lab sessionsâ€”we have innovated with a brand-new infrastructure. We leverage a JupyterHub server where all the lab guides are stored in notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A notebook is a series of cells.\n",
    "- Notebooks use a kernel (visible in the upper right corner).\n",
    "- Cells can be either Markdown or code (in the selected kernel).\n",
    "- To run a cell, you can:\n",
    "  - Click the Play button at the top.\n",
    "  - Press **Ctrl+Enter** (run and stay on the same cell).\n",
    "  - Press **Shift+Enter** (run and move to the next cell).\n",
    "- Running a Markdown cell renders it.\n",
    "- Running a code cell executes the code and displays the output just below the cell.\n",
    "- When a cell is running, it displays a `[*]` to its left; when finished, it shows an execution count.\n",
    "- You cannot run a cell while another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the Stop button.\n",
