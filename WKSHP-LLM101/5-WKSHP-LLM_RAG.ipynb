    "# Lab 5: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore the concept of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** within the LL-Mesh platform. RAG is a crucial process that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with access to external knowledge. Unlike traditional generation techniques, which rely solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, RAG allows the model to retrieve relevant data from external sources, improving both the relevance and accuracy of the responses. LL-Mesh provides all the necessary tools to build a powerful RAG system by handling:\n",

    "## Data Pipeline for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In LL-Mesh, the RAG process is divided into two main stages: **Data Injection** (where data is injected into the LLM's reasoning) and **Data Retrieval** (where relevant information is retrieved to support generation). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Injection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Injection Process** is a critical step in **RAG**, where data is prepared and integrated into a storage system for efficient retrieval during the generation process. This process ensures that the relevant data is available in a format that the LLM can easily access and use to enhance the quality and relevance of its outputs. In LL-Mesh, the Injection Process is abstracted into several key steps, including data extraction, transformation, and storage injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Extract\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Gathering**: The first step in the injection process involves collecting raw data from various sources. This data can come in different formats such as DOCX, PDF, Excel, or even API responses. The goal is to bring together all the information that may be relevant for the tasks the LLM will perform.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Conversion**: Once the data is gathered, it needs to be converted into a common format—typically JSON—to ensure consistency across different data types and sources. This conversion process makes it easier to standardize the subsequent transformation and storage processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clean**: In this stage, irrelevant or redundant information is removed from the data. This might involve eliminating duplicates, irrelevant sections, or noisy data that doesn't contribute to the task at hand. The goal is to focus on the core, useful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enrich Metadata**: Adding metadata to the data helps improve its searchability and contextual relevance during the retrieval process. Metadata can include information such as the source, keywords, timestamps, and other contextual markers that make it easier to retrieve and use the data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transform with LLM**: This is where the power of the LLM comes into play. The cleaned data can be transformed into useful formats such as summaries, question-and-answer pairs, or structured outputs. This transformation makes it easier for the LLM to access and use the data in specific ways during the generation process, ensuring that the most relevant information is readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Load\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Injection**: Once the data is transformed, it is injected into the chosen storage solution. This is typically a **vector database**, which allows for fast and efficient retrieval based on the content's semantic meaning. The vector database stores the transformed data in a format that the LLM can easily access during generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptation**: To optimize data retrieval, the stored data may be further adapted by **chunking** it into smaller, manageable pieces. This process ensures that data is stored in a way that allows the LLM to retrieve only the relevant portions when needed, improving both speed and accuracy during the generation process.\n",

    "### Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves gathering information from a variety of sources and document types, preparing it for further processing in the RAG pipeline. The goal of data extraction is to retrieve relevant information from diverse formats—such as PDFs, DOCX files, or web data—and convert it into a standardized format that can be used efficiently by the system in subsequent stages like transformation, storage, and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Format Support**:\n",
    "   - The Data Extraction service is designed to handle a wide variety of document types, such as **PDF**, **DOCX**, **HTML**, and **XLS** files. This flexibility allows LL-Mesh to process data from different sources and industries.\n",
    "   - Supports extracting both text and metadata from these files, ensuring that all relevant information is captured for downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Once the data is extracted from its original format, it is converted into a **standardized format**, typically **JSON**. This uniform format ensures that the data can be seamlessly integrated into the rest of the RAG pipeline, enabling consistency in the way the data is transformed, stored, and retrieved.\n",
    "   - Extracted data can include both text and structural elements like tables, lists, and headers, which are preserved in the standardized format."

    "\n",
    "After the data has been extracted from various sources, the transformation phase ensures that the data is cleaned, optimized, and enriched, making it ready for efficient storage and retrieval. This stage prepares the data in such a way that it can be seamlessly integrated into the retrieval process, allowing language models to access, understand, and use the data effectively during generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - **Remove Redundant Information**: The transformation process begins by cleaning the extracted data. This involves removing irrelevant, duplicate, or noisy content that could confuse or slow down the retrieval and generation processes.\n",
    "   - **Focus on Core Content**: By focusing on essential content, the data is made leaner and more relevant, ensuring that only the most useful and accurate information is retained for use by the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metadata Enrichment**:\n",
    "   - **Add Contextual Metadata**: Additional metadata, such as keywords, categories, timestamps, and author information, is added to the data during the transformation phase. This enrichment makes the data easier to search and retrieve by improving the system’s ability to match queries with relevant content.\n",
    "   - **Enhance Searchability**: Metadata plays a vital role in making the retrieval process more efficient, ensuring that specific queries lead to precise results. The more enriched the metadata, the more accurate the retrieval, helping the LLM generate contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformation**:\n",
    "   - **Generate Summaries and Q&A Pairs**: The data can also be processed with the help of LLMs to create summaries, question-and-answer pairs, or other useful formats that facilitate quicker retrieval and understanding during the generation phase. This transformation allows the LLM to directly interact with summarized or structured data, improving the quality and relevance of the generated responses.\n",
    "   - **Chunking for Optimization**: The data may also be broken into smaller chunks or sections that allow for quicker, more targeted retrieval during the generation process. Chunking ensures that the language model retrieves only the most relevant pieces of data, improving both response time and accuracy."

    "- **Refinement**: After an initial retrieval, metadata filtering is applied to refine the search results. By utilizing the metadata added during the **Injection Process**, the system can narrow down the retrieved data to ensure it closely aligns with the specific needs of the query. For example, filters can be applied based on the document source, creation date, or topic tags to return only the most relevant sections of data.\n",

    "#### 3. Chunk Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Expansion**: In some cases, the initial retrieved data may only include small sections of text or partial results. To provide more comprehensive context, the system applies **chunk expansion**, which expands the data around the retrieved sections, either by adding surrounding paragraphs, sections, or related sentences. This ensures that the LLM has access to a more complete and contextually rich dataset when generating responses, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.\n",

3gpp access then the pdu session status indicates the established pdu session of the current plmn in the ue. the follow - on request is included when the ue has pending uplink signalling and the ue doesn't include list of pdu sessions to be activated, or the registration type indicates the ue wants to perform an emergency registration. in initial registration and mobility registration update, ue provides the ue requested drx parameters, as defined in clause 5. 4. 5 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the ue may provide the extended idle mode drx parameters as defined in clause 5. 31. 7. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] to request extended idle mode drx. the ue provides ue radio capability update indication as described in ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the ue includes the mico indication and optionally a requested active time value and requested periodic update time value if the ue wants to use mico mode with active time. for a ue using nr satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage or an event is triggered in the ue that would make the ue unavailable for a certain period of time, the ue may include an unavailability type, an unavailability period duration and / or start of unavailability period as described in clause 5. 4. 13. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the ue may indicate its service gap control capability in the ue mm core network capability, see clause 5. 31. 16 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. for a ue with a running service gap timer in the ue, the ue shall not set follow - on request indication or uplink data status in the registration request message ( see clause 5. 31. 16 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ), except for network access for regulatory prioritized services like emergency services or exception reporting. if ue supports racs and has been assigned ue radio capability id ( s ), the ue shall indicate a ue radio capability id as defined in clause 5. 4. 4. 1a of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] as non - cleartext ie. the pei may be retrieved in initial registration from the ue as described in clause 4. 2. 2. 2. 1. if a ue supports the subscription - based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, it includes the nssrg handling support indication in the ue 5gmm core network capability according to clause 5. 15. 12 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf stores whether the ue supports this feature in the ue context. if a ue supports the temporary available network slices feature, it includes the indication of support for temporary available network slices in the ue 5gmm network capability according to clause 5. 15. 16 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. when a multi - usim ue wants to enter cm - idle state immediately e. g. after having performed mobility or periodic registration, it includes the release request indication and optionally provides paging restriction information. when the ue is performing a disaster roaming registration, the ue may indicate the plmn with disaster condition for the cases as defined in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. 2. if a 5g - s - tmsi or guami is not included or the 5g - s - tmsi or guami does not indicate a valid amf the ( r ) an, based on ( r ) at and requested nssai, if available, selects an amf the ( r ) an selects an amf as described in clause 6. 3. 5 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if ue is in cm - connected state, the ( r ) an can forward the registration request message to the amf based on the n2 connection of the ue. if the ( r ) an cannot select an appropriate amf, it forwards the registration request to an amf which has been configured, in ( r ) an, to perform amf selection. 3. ( r ) an to new amf : n2 message ( n2 parameters, registration request ( as described in step 1 ) and [ lte - m indication ]. when ng - ran is used, the n2 parameters include the selected plmn id ( or plmn id and nid, see clause 5. 30 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ), location information and cell identity related to the cell in which the ue is camping, ue context request which indicates that a ue context including security information needs to be setup at the ng - ran. when ng - ran is used, the n2 parameters shall also include the establishment cause and iab - indication or mbsr indication if the indication is received in an parameters in step 1. mapping of requested nssai is provided only if available. if the registration type indicated by the ue is periodic registration update, then steps 4 to 19 may be omitted. when the establishment cause is associated with priority services ( e. g. mps, mcs ), the amf includes a message priority header to indicate priority information. other nfs relay the priority information by including the message priority header in service - based interfaces, as specified in ts 29. 500 [ 17 ]. the rat type the ue is using is determined ( see clause 4. 2. 2. 2. 1 ) and based on it the amf determines whether the ue is performing inter - rat mobility to or from nb - iot. if the amf receives the lte m indication, then it considers that the rat type is lte - m and stores the lte - m indication in ue context. if a ue includes a preferred network behaviour, this defines the network behaviour the ue supports and is expecting to be available in the network as defined in clause 5. 31. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has included the preferred network behaviour and what the ue indicated it supports in preferred network behaviour is incompatible with the network support, the amf shall reject the registration request with an appropriate cause value ( e. g. one that avoids retries on this plmn ). if there is a service gap timer running in the ue context in amf for the ue and follow - on request indication or uplink data status is included in the registration request message, the amf shall ignore the follow - on request indication and uplink data status and not perform any of the actions related to the status. if the ue has included a ue radio capability id in step 1 and the amf supports racs, the amf stores the radio capability id in ue context. for nr satellite access, the amf may verify the ue location and determine whether the plmn is allowed to operate at the ue location, as described in clause 5. 4. 11. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue receives a registration reject message with cause value indicating that the plmn is not allowed to operate at the present ue location, the ue shall attempt to select a plmn as specified in ts 23. 122 [ 22 ]. for a disaster roaming registration, based on the uli ( including cell id ) received from the ng - ran, the plmn with disaster condition derived from the ue's 5g - guti, derived from the ue's suci or indicated by the ue and the local configuration, the amf determines if disaster roaming service can be provided. if the current location is not subject to disaster roaming service or the disaster roaming service is not provided to the plmn with disaster condition derived from the ue's 5g - guti, derived from the ue's suci or indicated by ue, then the amf should reject the registration request indicating a suitable cause value. 4. [ conditional ] new amf to old amf : namf _ communication _ uecontexttransfer ( complete registration request ) or new amf to udsf : nudsf _ unstructured data management _ query ( ). the new amf determines the old amf using the ue's 5g - guti. if the new amf received an nid in the registration request, it determines that the 5g - guti was assigned by an snpn and determines the old amf using the 5g - guti and nid of the snpn. ( with udsf deployment ) : if the ue's 5g - guti was included in the registration request and the serving amf has changed since last registration procedure, new amf and old amf are in the same amf set and udsf is deployed, the new amf retrieves the stored ue's supi and ue context directly from the udsf using nudsf _ unstructureddatamanagement _ query service operation or they can share stored ue context via implementation specific means if udsf is not deployed. this includes also event subscription information by each nf consumer for the given ue. in this case, the new amf uses integrity protected complete registration request nas message to perform and verify integrity protection. ( without udsf deployment ) : if the ue's 5g - guti was included in the registration request and the serving amf has changed since last registration procedure, the new amf may invoke the namf _ communication _ uecontexttransfer service operation on the old amf including the complete registration request nas message, which may be integrity protected, as well as the access type, to request the ue's supi and ue context. see clause 5. 2. 2. 2. 2 for details of this service operation. in this case, the old amf uses either 5g - guti and the integrity protected complete registration request nas message, or the supi and an indication that the ue is validated from the new amf, to verify integrity protection if the context transfer service operation invocation corresponds to the ue requested. the old amf also transfers the event subscriptions information by each nf consumer, for the ue, to the new amf . if the old amf has not yet reported a non - zero mo exception data counter to the ( h - ) smf, the context response also includes the mo exception data counter. if the old amf has pdu sessions for another access type ( different from the access type indicated in this step ) and if the old amf determines that there is no possibility for relocating the n2 interface to the new amf, the old amf returns ue's supi and indicates that the registration request has been validated for integrity protection, but does not include the rest of the ue context. for inter plmn mobility, ue context information includes hplmn s - nssais corresponding to the allowed nssai for each access type and partially allowed nssai, without allowed nssai and partially allowed nssai of old plmn. note 5 : the new amf sets the indication that the ue is validated according to step 9a, if the new amf has performed successful ue authentication after previous integrity check failure in the old amf. note 6 : the nf consumers do not need to subscribe for the events once again with the new amf after the ue is successfully registered with the new amf. if the new amf has already received ue contexts from the old amf during handover procedure, then step 4, 5 and 10 shall be skipped. for an emergency registration, if the ue identifies itself with a 5g - guti that is not known to the amf, steps 4 and 5 are skipped and the amf immediately requests the supi from the ue. if the ue identifies itself with pei, the supi request shall be skipped. allowing emergency registration without a user identity is dependent on local regulations. 5. [ conditional ] old amf to new amf : response to namf _ communication _ uecontexttransfer ( supi, ue context in amf ( as per table 5. 2. 2. 2. 2 - 1 ) ) or udsf to new amf : nudsf _ unstructured data management _ query ( ). the old amf may start an implementation specific ( guard ) timer for the ue context. if the udsf was queried in step 4, the udsf responds to the new amf for the nudsf _ unstructured data management _ query invocation with the related contexts including established pdu sessions, the old amf includes smf information dnn, s - nssai ( s ) and pdu session id, active ngap ue - tnla bindings to n3iwf / tngf / w - agf, the old amf includes information about the ngap ue - tnla bindings. if the old amf was queried in step 4, old amf responds to the new amf for the namf _ communication _ uecontexttransfer invocation by including the ue's supi and ue context. if old amf holds information about established pdu session ( s ) and it is not an initial registration, the old amf includes smf information, dnn ( s ), s - nssai ( s ) and pdu session id ( s ). if old amf holds ue context established via n3iwf, w - agf or tngf, the old amf includes the cm state via n3iwf, w - agf or tngf. if the ue is in cm - connected state via n3iwf, w - agf or tngf, the old amf includes information about the ngap ue - tnla bindings. if old amf fails the integrity check of the registration request nas message, the old amf shall indicate the integrity check failure. if the new amf is configured to allow emergency services for unauthenticated ue, the new amf behaves as follows : if the ue has only an emergency pdu session, the amf either skips the authentication and security procedure or accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the mobility registration update procedure ; or if the ue has both emergency and non emergency pdu sessions and authentication fails, the amf continues the mobility registration update procedure and deactivates all the non - emergency pdu sessions as specified in clause 4. 3. 4. 2. note 7 : the new amf can determine if a pdu session is used for emergency service by checking whether the dnn matches the emergency dnn. if old amf holds information about am policy association and the information about ue policy association ( i. e. the policy control request trigger for updating ue policy as defined in ts 23. 503 [ 20 ] ), the old amf includes the information about the am policy association, the ue policy association and pcf id. in the roaming case, v - pcf id and h - pcf id are included. if old amf was a consumer of ue related nwdaf services, the old amf includes information about active analytics subscriptions, i. e. the subscription correlation id, nwdaf identifier ( i. e. instance id or set id ), analytics id ( s ) and associated analytics specific data in the namf _ communication _ uecontexttransfer response. usage of the analytics information by the new amf is specified in ts 23. 288 [ 50 ]. during inter plmn mobility, the handling of the ue radio capability id in the new amf is as defined in ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. note 8 : when new amf uses udsf for context retrieval, interactions between old amf, new amf and udsf due to ue signalling on old amf at the same time is implementation issue. 6. [ conditional ] new amf to ue : identity request ( ). if the suci is not provided by the ue nor retrieved from the old amf the identity request procedure is initiated by amf sending an identity request message to the ue requesting the suci. 7. [ conditional ] ue to new amf : identity response ( ). the ue responds with an identity response message including the suci. the ue derives the suci by using the provisioned public key of the hplmn, as specified in ts 33. 501 [ 15 ]. 8. the amf may decide to initiate ue authentication by invoking an ausf. in that case, the amf selects an ausf based on supi or suci, as described in clause 6. 3. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the amf is configured to support emergency registration for unauthenticated supis and the ue indicated registration type emergency registration, the amf skips the authentication or the amf accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the registration procedure. 9a. if authentication is required, the amf requests it from the ausf ; if tracing requirements about the ue are available at the amf, the amf provides tracing requirements in its request to ausf. for a disaster roaming registration, the amf may provide the indication of disaster roaming service in its request to ausf. upon request from the amf, the ausf shall execute authentication of the ue. the authentication is performed as described in ts 33. 501 [ 15 ]. the ausf selects a udm as described in clause 6. 3. 8 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] and gets the authentication data from udm. the ausf may provide the indication of disaster roaming service to udm if the indication is received from amf. for a disaster roaming registration, the ausf executes authentication of the ue based on the local policy and / or local configuration as specified in clause 5. 40. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] and in ts 33. 501 [ 15 ]. once the ue has been authenticated the ausf provides relevant security related information to the amf. if the amf provided a suci to ausf, the ausf shall return the supi to amf only after the authentication is successful. after successful authentication in new amf, which is triggered by the integrity check failure in old amf at step 5, the new amf invokes step 4 above again and indicates that the ue is validated ( i. e. through the reason parameter as specified in clause 5. 2. 2. 2. 2 ). 9b if nas security context does not exist, the nas security initiation is performed as described in ts 33. 501 [ 15 ]. if the ue had no nas security context in step 1, the ue includes the full registration request message as defined in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. the amf decides if the registration request needs to be rerouted as described in clause 4. 2. 2. 2. 3, where the initial amf refers to the amf. 9c. the amf initiates ngap procedure to provide the 5g - an with security context as specified in ts 38. 413 [ 10 ] if the 5g - an had requested for ue context. also, if the amf decides that eps fallback is supported ( e. g. based on ue capability to support request type flag \" handover \" for pdn connectivity request during the attach procedure as defined in clause 5. 17. 2. 3. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ], subscription data and local policy ), the amf shall send an indication \" redirection for eps fallback for voice is possible \" towards 5g - an as specified in ts 38. 413 [ 10 ]. otherwise, the amf indicates \" redirection for eps fallback for voice is not possible \". in addition, if tracing requirements about the ue are available at the amf, the amf provides the 5g - an with tracing requirements in the ngap procedure. if qmc configuration information is available at the amf, the amf provides the 5g - an with qmc configuration information in the ngap procedure. 9d. the 5g - an stores the security context and acknowledges to the amf. the 5g - an uses the security context to protect the messages exchanged with the ue as described in ts 33. 501 [ 15 ]. 10. [ conditional ] new amf to old amf : namf _ communication _ registrationstatusupdate ( pdu session id ( s ) to be released e. g. due to slice not supported ). if the amf has changed the new amf informs the old amf that the registration of the ue in the new amf is completed by invoking the namf _ communication _ registrationstatusupdate service operation. if the authentication / security procedure fails, then the registration shall be rejected and the new amf invokes the namf _ communication _ registrationstatusupdate service operation with a reject indication towards the old amf. the old amf continues as if the ue context transfer service operation was never received. the new amf determines the pdu session ( s ) that cannot be supported in the new registration area in the cases below : if one or more of the s - nssais used in the old registration area cannot be served in the target registration area. when continuity of the pdu session ( s ) cannot be supported between networks ( e. g. snpn - snpn mobility, inter - plmn mobility where no hr agreement exists ). if any of the cases is met, the new amf invokes the namf _ communication _ registrationstatusupdate service operation including the rejected pdu session id towards the old amf. then the new amf modifies the pdu session status correspondingly. the old amf informs the corresponding smf ( s ) to locally release the ue's sm context by invoking the nsmf _ pdusession _ releasesmcontext service operation. if new amf received in the ue context transfer in step 5 the information about the am policy association and the ue policy association and decides, based on local policies, not to use the pcf ( s ) identified by the pcf id ( s ) for the am policy association and the ue policy association, then it will inform the old amf that the am policy association and the ue policy association in the ue context is not used any longer and then the pcf selection is performed in step 15. if the new amf received in the ue context transfer in step 5 the information about ue related analytics subscription ( s ), the new amf may take over the analytics subscription ( s ) from the old amf. otherwise, if the new amf instead determines to create new analytics subscription ( s ), it informs the old amf about the analytics subscriptions ( identified by their subscription correlation id ) that are not needed any longer and the old amf may now unsubscribe those nwdaf analytics subscriptions for the ue according to ts 23. 288 [ 50 ]. 11. [ conditional ] new amf to ue : identity request / response ( pei ). if the pei was not provided by the ue nor retrieved from the old amf the identity request procedure is initiated by amf sending an identity request message to the ue to retrieve the pei. the pei shall be transferred encrypted unless the ue performs emergency registration and cannot be authenticated. for an emergency registration, the ue may have included the pei in the registration request. if so, the pei retrieval is skipped. if the ue supports racs as indicated in ue mm core network capability, the amf shall use the pei of the ue to obtain the imei / tac for the purpose of racs operation. 12. optionally the new amf initiates me identity check by invoking the n5g - eir _ equipmentidentitycheck _ get service operation ( see clause 5. 2. 4. 2. 2 ). the pei check is performed as described in clause 4. 7. for an emergency registration, if the pei is blocked, operator policies determine whether the emergency registration procedure continues or is stopped. 13. if step 14 is to be performed, the new amf, based on the supi, selects a udm, then udm may select a udr instance. see clause 6. 3. 9 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf selects a udm as described in clause 6. 3. 8 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. 14a - c. if the amf has changed since the last registration procedure, if ue registration type is initial registration or emergency registration, or if the ue provides a supi which does not refer to a valid context in the amf, or if the ue registers to the same amf it has already registered to a non - 3gpp access ( i. e. the ue is registered over a non - 3gpp access and initiates this registration procedure to add a 3gpp access ), the new amf registers with the udm using nudm _ uecm _ registration for the access to be registered ( and subscribes to be notified when the udm deregisters this amf ). the udm based on the \" registration type \" in the nudm _ uecm _ registration request, can act on sor information according to ts 23. 122 [ 22 ]. in this case, if the amf does not have event exposure subscription information for this ue, the amf indicates it to udm . then, if the udm has existing applicable event exposure subscriptions for events detected in amf for this ue or for any of the groups this ue belongs to ( possibly retrieved from udr ), udm invokes the namf _ eventexposure _ subscribe service for recreating the event exposure subscriptions. the amf provides the \" homogenous support of ims voice over ps sessions \" indication ( see clause 5. 16. 3. 3 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) to the udm. the \" homogenous support of ims voice over ps sessions \" indication shall not be included unless the amf has completed its evaluation of the support of \" ims voice over ps session \" as specified in clause 5. 16. 3. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. during initial registration, if the amf and ue supports srvcc from ng - ran to utran the amf provides udm with the ue srvcc capability. if the amf determines that only the ue srvcc capability has changed, the amf sends ue srvcc capability to the udm. note 9 : at this step, it is possible that the amf does not have all the information needed to determine the setting of the ims voice over ps session supported indication for this ue ( see clause 5. 16. 3. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ). hence the amf can send the \" homogenous support of ims voice over ps sessions \" later on in this procedure. after amf has successfully completed the nudm _ uecm _ registration operation and if the amf does not have subscription data for the ue, the amf retrieves the access and mobility subscription data, smf selection subscription data, ue context in smf data and lcs mobile origination using nudm _ sdm _ get. if the amf already has subscription data for the ue but the sor update indicator in the ue context requires the amf to retrieve sor information depending on the nas registration type ( \" initial registration \" or \" emergency registration \" ) ( see annex c of ts 23. 122 [ 22 ] ), the amf retrieves the steering of roaming information using nudm _ sdm _ get. this requires that udm may retrieve this information from udr by nudr _ dm _ query. after a successful response is received, the amf subscribes to be notified using nudm _ sdm _ subscribe when the data requested is modified, udm may subscribe to udr by nudr _ dm _ subscribe. the gpsi is provided to the amf in the access and mobility subscription data from the udm if the gpsi is available in the ue subscription data. the udm may provide indication that the subscription data for network slicing is updated for the ue . if the ue is subscribed to mps in the serving plmn, \" mps priority \" is included in the access and mobility subscription data provided to the amf. if the ue is subscribed to mcx in the serving plmn, \" mcx priority \" is included in the access and mobility subscription data provided to the amf. the udm also provides the iab - operation allowed indication or mbsr operation allowed indication to amf as part of the access and mobility subscription data. the amf shall trigger the setup of the ue context in ng - ran, or modification of the ue context in ng - ran if the initial setup is at step 9c, including an indication that the iab - node is authorized or mbsr is authorized . if a s - nssai in the subscribed s - nssais is subject to network slice usage control and the s - nssai is dedicated to a single af, the udm may provide a slice usage policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a slice deregistration inactivity timer value for the subscribed s - nssais as described in clause 5. 15. 15 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the udm may provide the ncr - operation allowed indication to amf as part of the access and mobility subscription data. the amf shall trigger the setup of the ue context in ng - ran, or modification of the ue context in ng - ran if the initial setup is at step 9c, including an indication of ncr - mt authorization information. for a disaster roaming registration, the amf may provide the indication of disaster roaming service to the udm. the udm provides the subscription data for a disaster roaming service to the amf based on the local policy and / or the local configuration as specified in clause 5. 40. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf provides mint support indication via nudm _ uecm _ registration towards udm, if ue includes the mint support indication in the 5gmm capability as specified in clause 5. 40. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] or if the mint support indication in the 5gmm capability is changed. if the amf receives a priority indication ( e. g. mps, mcx ) as part of the access and mobility subscription data, but the ue did not provide an establishment cause associated with priority services, the amf shall include a message priority header to indicate priority information for all subsequent messages. other nfs relay the priority information by including the message priority header in service - based interfaces, as specified in ts 29. 500 [ 17 ]. the new amf provides the access type it serves for the ue to the udm and the access type is set to \" 3gpp access \". the udm stores the associated access type together with the serving amf and does not remove the amf identity associated to the other access type if any. the udm may store in udr information provided at the amf registration by nudr _ dm _ update. if the ue was registered in the old amf for an access and the old and the new amfs are in the same plmn, the new amf sends a separate / independent nudm _ uecm _ registration to update udm with access type set to access used in the old amf, after the old amf relocation is successfully completed. the new amf creates an ue context for the ue after getting the access and mobility subscription data from the udm. the access and mobility subscription data includes whether the ue is allowed to include nssai in the 3gpp access rrc connection establishment in clear text. the access and mobility subscription data may include enhanced coverage restricted information. if received from the udm and the ue included support for restriction of use of enhanced coverage in step 1, the amf determines whether enhanced coverage is restricted or not for the ue as specified in clause 5. 31. 12 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] and stores the updated enhanced coverage restricted information in the ue context. the access and mobility subscription data may include the nb - iot ue priority. for subscribed s - nssais subject to nsac, the amf stores the corresponding applicable nsac admission mode. the subscription data may contain service gap time parameter. if received from the udm, the amf stores this service gap time in the ue context in amf for the ue. if the amf has the ladn service area and ue indication of support for ladn per dnn and s - nssai, the amf applies ladn per dnn and s - nssai as described in 5. 20b. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. for an emergency registration in which the ue was not successfully authenticated, the amf shall not register with the udm. the amf enforces the mobility restrictions as specified in clause 5. 3. 4. 1. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. for an emergency registration, the amf shall not check for mobility restrictions, access restrictions, regional restrictions or subscription restrictions. for an emergency registration, the amf shall ignore any unsuccessful registration response from udm and continue with the registration procedure. note 10 : the amf can, instead of the nudm _ sdm _ get service operation, use the nudm _ sdm _ subscribe service operation with an immediate report indication that triggers the udm to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the amf and the udm. 14d. when the udm stores the associated access type ( e. g. 3gpp ) together with the serving amf as indicated in step 14a, it will cause the udm to initiate a nudm _ uecm _ deregistrationnotification ( see clause 5. 2. 3. 2. 2 ) to the old amf corresponding to the same ( e. g. 3gpp ) access, if one exists. if the timer started in step 5 is not running, the old amf may remove the ue context for the same access type. otherwise, the amf may remove ue context for the same access type when the timer expires. if the serving nf removal reason indicated by the udm is initial registration, then, as described in clause 4. 2. 2. 3. 2, the old amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ releasesmcontext ( sm context id ) service operation towards all the associated smf ( s ) of the ue to notify that the ue is deregistered from old amf for the same access type. the smf ( s ) shall release the pdu session on getting this notification. if the old amf has established an am policy association and a ue policy association with the pcf ( s ) and the old amf did not transfer the pcf id ( s ) to the new amf ( e. g. new amf is in different plmn ), the old amf performs an amf - initiated policy association termination procedure, as defined in clause 4. 16. 3. 2 and performs an amf - initiated ue policy association termination procedure, as defined in clause 4. 16. 13. 1. in addition, if the old amf transferred the pcf id ( s ) in the ue context but the new amf informed in step 10 that the am policy association information and ue policy association information in the ue context will not be used then the old amf performs an amf - initiated policy association termination procedure, as defined in clause 4. 16. 3. 2 and performs an amf - initiated ue policy association termination procedure, as defined in clause 4. 16. 13. 1. if the old amf has an n2 connection for that ue ( e. g. because the ue was in rrc _ inactive state but has now moved to e - utran or moved to an area not served by the old amf ), the old amf shall perform an release ( see clause 4. 2. 6 ) with a cause value that indicates that the ue has already locally released the ng - ran's rrc connection. if the ue context in the old amf contains an allowed nssai or partially allowed nssai including one or more s - nssai ( s ) subject to nsac, the old amf upon receipt of the nudm _ uecm _ deregistrationnotification from the udm, sends an update request message for each s - nssai subject to nsac to the corresponding nsacf ( s ) with update flag parameter set to decrease ( see clause 4. 2. 11. 2 ). at the end of registration procedure, the amf may initiate synchronization of event exposure subscriptions with the udm if the amf does not indicate unavailability of event exposure subscription in step 14a. note 11 : the amf can initiate synchronization with udm even if events are available in the ue context ( e. g. as received from old amf ) at any given time and based on local policy. this can be done during subscription change related event. 14e. [ conditional ] if old amf does not have ue context for another access type ( i. e. non - 3gpp access ), the old amf unsubscribes with the udm for subscription data using nudm _ sdm _ unsubscribe. 15. if the amf decides to initiate pcf communication, the amf acts as follows. if the new amf decides to use the ( v - ) pcf identified by the ( v - ) pcf id included in ue context from the old amf in step 5, the amf contacts the ( v - ) pcf identified by the ( v - ) pcf id to obtain policy. if the amf decides to perform pcf discovery and selection and the amf selects a ( v ) - pcf and may select an h - pcf ( for roaming scenario ) as described in clause 6. 3. 7. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] and according to the v - nrf to h - nrf interaction described in clause 4. 3. 2. 2. 3. 3. 16. [ optional ] new amf performs an am policy association establishment / modification. for an emergency registration, this step is skipped. if the new amf selects a new ( v - ) pcf in step 15, the new amf performs am policy association establishment with the selected ( v - ) pcf as defined in clause 4. 16. 1. 2. if the ( v - ) pcf identified by the ( v - ) pcf id included in ue context from the old amf is used, the new amf performs am policy association modification with the ( v - ) pcf as defined in clause 4. 16. 2. 1. 2. if the amf notifies the mobility restrictions ( e. g. ue location ) to the pcf for adjustment, or if the pcf updates the mobility restrictions itself due to some conditions ( e. g. application in use, time and date ), the pcf shall provide the updated mobility restrictions to the amf. if the subscription information includes tracing requirements, the amf provides the pcf with tracing requirements. if the amf supports dnn replacement, the amf provides the pcf with the allowed nssai and partially allowed nssai and if available, the mapping of allowed nssai and mapping of partially allowed nssai. if the pcf supports dnn replacement, the pcf provides the amf with triggers for dnn replacement. if the pcf supports the slice replacement, the pcf provides the amf with triggers for slice replacement. if a s - nssai in subject to network slice usage control, the pcf may provide a slice usage policy information including, whether a network slice is on demand and a slice deregistration inactivity timer value, for the subscribed s - nssais as described in clause 5. 15. 15 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. 17. [ conditional ] amf to smf : nsmf _ pdusession _ updatesmcontext ( ) or nsmf _ pdusession _ releasesmcontext ( ). for an emergency registered ue ( see ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ), this step is applied when the registration type is mobility registration update. the amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ updatesmcontext ( see clause 5. 2. 8. 2. 6 ) in the following scenario ( s ) : if the list of pdu sessions to be activated is included in the registration request in step 1, the amf sends nsmf _ pdusession _ updatesmcontext request to smf ( s ) associated with the pdu session ( s ) in order to activate user plane connections of these pdu session ( s ). steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4. 2. 3. 2 are executed to complete the user plane connection activation without sending the rrc inactive assistance information and without sending mm nas service accept from the amf to ( r ) an described in step 12 of clause 4. 2. 3. 2. when a user plane connection for a pdu session is activated, the as layer in the ue indicates it to the nas layer. if the amf has determined in step 3 that the ue is performing inter - rat mobility to or from nb - iot, the amf sends nsmf _ pdusession _ updatesmcontext request to smf ( s ) associated with the ues pdu session ( s ), so the smf ( s ) can update them according to the \" pdu session continuity at inter rat mobility \" subscription data. steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4. 2. 3. 2 are executed without sending mm nas service accept from the amf to ( r ) an described in step 12 of clause 4. 2. 3. 2. when the serving amf has changed, the new serving amf notifies the smf for each pdu session that it has taken over the responsibility of the signalling path towards the ue : the new serving amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ updatesmcontext service operation using smf information received from the old amf at step 5. it also indicates whether the pdu session is to be re - activated. note 12 : if the ue moves into a different plmn, the amf in the serving plmn can insert or change the v - smf ( s ) in the serving plmn for home routed pdu session ( s ). in addition, a v - smf is removed in case the ue moves from a vplmn into the hplmn. in these cases, the same procedures described in clause 4. 23. 3 are applied for the v - smf change as for the i - smf change ( i. e. by replacing the i - smf with v - smf ). during inter - plmn change, if the same smf is used, session continuity can be supported depending on operator policies. steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4. 2. 3. 2 are executed. in the case that the intermediate upf insertion, removal, or change is performed for the pdu session ( s ) not included in \" pdu session ( s ) to be re - activated \", the procedure is performed without n11 and n2 interactions to update the n3 user plane between ( r ) an and 5gc. the amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ releasesmcontext service operation towards the smf in the following scenario : if any pdu session status indicates that it is released at the ue, the amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ releasesmcontext service operation towards the smf in order to release any network resources related to the pdu session. if the ue has moved into a ta not supporting the s - nssai associated with the pdu session, and the amf determines to release the pdu session, and no n2 interaction is needed ( i. e. up connection of the pdu session is not active ), the amf sets the pdu session status indicating that the pdu session is released in the network and the amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ releasesmcontext service operation towards the smf. if the serving amf is changed, the new amf shall wait until step 18 is finished with all the smfs associated with the ue. otherwise, steps 19 to 22 can continue in parallel to this step. 18. [ conditional ] if the new amf and the old amf are in the same plmn, the new amf sends a ue context modification request to n3iwf / tngf / w - agf as specified in ts 29. 413 [ 64 ]. if the amf has changed and the old amf has indicated that the ue is in cm - connected state via n3iwf, w - agf or tngf and if the new amf and the old amf are in the same plmn, the new amf creates an ngap ue association towards the n3iwf / tngf / w - agf to which the ue is connected. this automatically releases the existing ngap ue association between the old amf and the n3iwf / tngf / w - agf. 19. n3iwf / tngf / w - agf sends a ue context modification response to the new amf. 19a. [ conditional ] after the new amf receives the response message from the n3iwf, w - agf or tngf in step 19, the new amf registers with the udm using nudm _ uecm _ registration as step 14a, but with the access type set to \" non - 3gpp access \". the udm stores the associated access type together with the serving amf and does not remove the amf identity associated to the other access type if any. the udm may store in udr information provided at the amf registration by nudr _ dm _ update. 19b. [ conditional ] when the udm stores the associated access type ( i. e. non - 3gpp ) together with the serving amf as indicated in step 19a, it will cause the udm to initiate a nudm _ uecm _ deregistrationnotification ( see clause 5. 2. 3. 2. 2 ) to the old amf corresponding to the same ( i. e. non - 3gpp ) access. the old amf removes the ue context for non - 3gpp access. 19c. the old amf unsubscribes with the udm for subscription data using nudm _ sdm _ unsubscribe. 20a. void. 21 . new amf to ue : registration accept ( 5g -

specific authentication and authorization and the amf determines that no s - nssai can be provided in the allowed nssai for the ue in the current ue's tracking area and if no default s - nssai ( s ) not yet involved in the current ue registration procedure could be further considered, the amf shall reject the ue registration and shall include in the rejection message the list of rejected s - nssais, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value. the allowed nssai for the access type for the ue is included in the n2 message carrying the registration accept message. the allowed nssai contains only s - nssais that do not require, based on subscription information, network slice - specific authentication and authorization and based on the ue context in the amf, those s - nssais for which network slice - specific authentication and authorization previously succeeded, regardless of the access type. the mapping of pending nssai is the mapping of each s - nssai of the pending nssai for the serving plmn to the hplmn s - nssais. if the ue has indicated its support for the partial network slice support in a registration area ( see clause 5. 15. 17 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) in the ue mm core network capability in the registration request, the amf may include partially allowed nssai in the registration accept with the related tai list for s - nssais in partially allowed nssai as per ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] clause 5. 1517 and in the n2 message carrying the registration accept message without the tai list for s - nssais in partially allowed nssai. the partially allowed nssai contains only s - nssais that do not require, based on subscription information, network slice - specific authentication and authorization and based on the ue context in the amf, those s - nssais for which network slice - specific authentication and authorization previously succeeded, regardless of the access type. the mapping of partially allowed nssai is the mapping of each s - nssai of the partially allowed nssai for the serving plmn to the hplmn s - nssais. if the ue has indicated its support for the partial network slice support in a registration area ( see clause 5. 15. 17 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) in the ue mm core network capability in the registration request, the amf may include s - nssai ( s ) rejected partially in the ra in the registration accept with the applicable tai list for rejected s - nssai partially in the ra. if the ue has indicated its support of the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure in the ue mm core network capability in the registration request, amf includes in the pending nssai the s - nssais that map to an s - nssai of the hplmn which in the subscription information has indication that it is subject to network slice - specific authentication and authorization, as described in clause 4. 6. 2. 4 of ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. in such case, the amf then shall trigger at step 25 the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure, specified in clause 4. 2. 9. 2, except, based on network policies, for those s - nssais for which network slice - specific authentication and authorization have already been initiated on another access type for the same s - nssai ( s ) . the ue shall not attempt re - registration with the s - nssais included in the list of pending nssais until the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed, regardless of the access type. if the ue has not indicated its support of the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure in the ue 5gmm core network capability in the registration request and the requested nssai includes s - nssais which map to hplmn s - nssais subject to network slice - specific authentication and authorization, the amf includes those s - nssais in the requested nssai in the rejected s - nssais. if no s - nssai can be provided in the allowed nssai because : all the s - nssai ( s ) in the requested nssai are to be subject to network slice - specific authentication and authorization ; or no requested nssai was provided or none of the s - nssais in the requested nssai matches any of the subscribed s - nssais and all the s - nssai ( s ) marked as default in the subscribed s - nssais are to be subject to network slice - specific authentication and authorization. the amf shall provide an empty allowed nssai. upon receiving an empty allowed nssai and a pending nssai, the ue is registered in the plmn but shall wait for the completion of the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure without attempting to use any service provided by the plmn on any access, except e. g. emergency services ( see ts 24. 501 [ 25 ] ), until the ue receives an allowed nssai. the amf stores the nb - iot priority retrieved in step 14 and associates it to the 5g - s - tmsi allocated to the ue. if the registration request message received over 3gpp access does not include any paging restriction information, the amf shall delete any stored paging restriction information for this ue and stop restricting paging accordingly. if the registration request message received over 3gpp access includes the paging restriction information, amf may accept or reject the paging restriction information requested by the ue based on operator policy. if the amf rejects the paging restriction information, the amf removes any stored paging restriction information from the ue context and discards the ue requested paging restriction information. if the amf accepts the paging restriction information from the ue, the amf stores the paging restriction information from the ue in the ue context and informs the ue about the acceptance / rejection of the requested paging restriction information in the registration accept message. if the registration request message received over 3gpp access includes a release request indication, then : the amf updates the ue context with any received paging restriction information, then enforces it in the network triggered service request procedure as described in clause 4. 2. 3. 3 ; the amf does not establish user plane resources and triggers the an release procedure as described in clause 4. 2. 6 after the completion of registration procedure. the amf sends a registration accept message to the ue indicating that the registration request has been accepted. 5g - guti is included if the amf allocates a new 5g - guti. upon receiving a registration request message of type \" initial registration \", \" mobility registration update \", \" disaster roaming initial registration \" or \" disaster roaming mobility registration update \" from the ue, the amf shall include a new 5g - guti in the registration accept message. upon receiving a registration request message of type \" periodic registration update \" from the ue, the amf should include a new 5g - guti in the registration accept message. if the ue is already in rm - registered state via another access in the same plmn, the ue shall use the 5g - guti received in the registration accept for both registrations. if no 5g - guti is included in the registration accept, then the ue uses the 5g - guti assigned for the existing registration also for the new registration . if the amf allocates a new registration area, it shall send the registration area to the ue via registration accept message. for a disaster roaming registration, the amf allocates the registration area limited to the area with disaster condition as specified in clause 5. 40 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if there is no registration area included in the registration accept message, the ue shall consider the old registration area as valid. mobility restrictions is included if mobility restrictions applies for the ue and registration type is not emergency registration. the amf indicates the established pdu sessions to the ue in the pdu session status. the ue removes locally any internal resources related to pdu sessions that are not marked as established in the received pdu session status . if the amf invokes the nsmf _ pdusession _ updatesmcontext procedure for up activation of pdu session ( s ) in step 18 and receives rejection from the smf, then the amf indicates to the ue the pdu session id and the cause why the user plane resources were not activated. when the ue is connected to the two amfs belonging to different plmn via 3gpp access and non - 3gpp access then the ue removes locally any internal resources related to the pdu session of the current plmn that are not marked as established in received pdu session status. if the pdu session status information was in the registration request, the amf shall indicate the pdu session status to the ue. if the rat type is nb - iot and the network is configured to use the control plane relocation indication procedure then the amf shall include in the registration accept message the truncated 5g - s - tmsi configuration that the ue using control plane ciot 5gs optimisation uses to create the truncated 5g - s - tmsi, see clause 5. 31. 4. 3 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the allowed nssai provided in the registration accept is valid in the registration area and it applies for all the plmns which have their tracking areas included in the registration area. the mapping of allowed nssai is the mapping of each s - nssai of the allowed nssai to the hplmn s - nssais. the mapping of configured nssai is the mapping of each s - nssai of the configured nssai for the serving plmn to the hplmn s - nssais. for non - roaming ue, if the ue has indicated its support of slice usage policy in the ue 5gmm core network capability, the amf may include slice usage policies for the slices in the configured nssai as described in clause 5. 15. 15 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. in the slice usage policy, the amf indicates if an s - nssai is on demand slice and optionally slice deregistration inactivity timer value. if the amf includes slice deregistration inactivity timer value, the ue starts any slice deregistration inactivity timer for the on demand s - nssais as described in clause 5. 15. 15 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the amf includes updated slice deregistration timer value ( s ), the ue uses the updated slice deregistration inactivity timer value ( s ) next time the slice deregistration inactivity timer ( s ) starts. if the ue has indicated its support of the subscription - based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature in the ue 5gmm core network capability, the amf includes, if available, the nssrg information, defined in clause 5. 15. 12 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has not indicated its support of the subscription - based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and the subscription information for the ue includes nssrg information and the amf is providing the configured nssai to the ue, the configured nssai shall include the s - nssais according to clause 5. 15. 12 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has indicated its support for temporary available network slices feature in the ue 5gmm core network capability, the amf includes validity time defined in clause 5. 15. 16 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has not indicated its support for temporary available network slices feature in the ue 5gmm core network capability and the amf is providing the configured nssai to the ue, the configured nssai shall not include the s - nssais if the validity time indicates s - nssai is not available according to clause 5. 15. 16 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has indicated its support of the nsag feature in the 5gmm core network capability, the amf includes, if available, the nsag information, defined in clause 5. 15. 14 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf shall include in the registration accept message the ladn information for the list of ladns, described in clause 5. 6. 5 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ], that are available within the registration area determined by the amf for the ue. if the ue indicates its support of ladn per dnn and s - nssai in the ue mm core network capability, the amf may include ladn information per dnn and s - nssai. the amf may include operator - defined access category definitions to let the ue determinine the applicable operator - specific access category definitions as described in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. if the ue included mico indication in the registration request, then amf responds in the registration accept message whether mico mode should be used in the mico indication. when mico mode is allowed for the ue, the amf may include an active time value and / or strictly periodic registration timer indication in the registration accept message. the amf determines the periodic registration update timer value, active time value and the strictly periodic registration timer indication based on : local configuration ; expected ue behaviour if available ; ue indicated preferences ; ue capability ; ue subscription information ; if using a ran that provides discontinuous coverage, ue availability ( see clause 5. 4. 13. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) ; and network policies, or any combination of them so as to enable ue power saving, as described in clause 5. 31. 7 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf determines to apply the strictly periodic registration timer indication to the ue if the ue indicates its capability of the strictly periodic registration timer indication in the registration request message, as described in step 1. if the amf provides the periodic registration update timer value with the strictly periodic registration timer indication to the ue, the ue and the amf start the periodic registration update timer after this step, as described in clause 5. 31. 7. 5 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. in the case of registration over 3gpp access, the amf sets the ims voice over ps session supported indication as described in clause 5. 16. 3. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. in order to set the ims voice over ps session supported indication the amf may need to perform the ue capability match request procedure in clause 4. 2. 8a to check the compatibility of the ue and ng - ran radio capabilities related to ims voice over ps. if the amf hasn't received voice support match indicator from the ng - ran on time then, based on implementation, amf may set ims voice over ps session supported indication and update it at a later stage. in the case of registration over 3gpp access and the amf has retrieved or determined according to local configuration a target nssai and a corresponding rfsp index for the purpose of allowing the ng - ran to redirect the ue to a cell supporting network slices not available in the current ta as described in clause 5. 3. 4. 3. 3 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ], the amf provides the target nssai and the corresponding rfsp index to the ng - ran. in the case of registration over non - 3gpp access, the amf sets the ims voice over ps session supported indication as described in clause 5. 16. 3. 2a of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the emergency service support indicator informs the ue that emergency services are supported, i. e. the ue is allowed to request pdu session for emergency services. if the amf received \" mps priority \" from the udm as part of access and mobility subscription data, based on operator policy, \" mps priority \" is included in the registration accept message to the ue to inform the ue whether configuration of access identity 1 is valid within the selected plmn, as specified in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. if the amf received \" mcx priority \" from the udm as part of access and mobility subscription data, based on operator policy and ue subscription to mcx services, \" mcx priority \" is included in the registration accept message to the ue to inform the ue whether configuration of access identity 2 is valid within the selected plmn, as specified in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. the accepted drx parameters are defined in clause 5. 4. 5 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf includes accepted drx parameters for nb - iot, if the ue included requested drx parameters for nb - iot in the registration request message. the amf sets the network support of interworking without n26 parameter as described in clause 5. 17. 2. 3. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the amf accepts the use of extended idle mode drx, the amf includes the extended idle mode drx parameters and paging time window as described in 5. 31. 7. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. for a ue using nr satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage, the amf may determine extended idle mode drx parameters and paging time window considering the unavailability period duration ( if available ), start of unavailability period ( if available ) and the ue requested extended idle mode drx parameters as described in clause 5. 4. 13. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the udm intends to indicate the ue that subscription has changed, the network slicing subscription change indication is included. if the amf includes network slicing subscription change indication, then the ue shall locally erase all the network slicing configuration for all plmns and if applicable, update the configuration for the current plmn based on any received information. the access stratum connection establishment nssai inclusion mode, as specified in clause 5. 15. 9 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ], is included to instruct the ue on what nssai, if any, to include in the access stratum connection establishment. the amf can set the value to modes of operation a, b, c defined in clause 5. 15. 9 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] in the 3gpp access only if the inclusion of nssai in rrc connection establishment allowed indicates that it is allowed to do so. for a ue registered in a plmn, the amf may provide a list of equivalent plmns which is handled as specified in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. the amf shall not provide a list of equivalent snpns to the ue. for a ue registered in an snpn and the ue has included support of equivalent snpns in step 1, the amf may provide a list of equivalent snpns which is handled as specified in ts 24. 501 [ 25 ]. the amf shall not provide a list of equivalent plmns to the ue. if the ue included support for restriction of use of enhanced coverage in step 1, the amf sends the enhanced coverage restricted information to the ng - ran in n2 message. the amf also sends enhanced coverage restricted information to the ue in the registration accept message. if the ue receives enhanced coverage restricted information in the registration accept message, the ue shall store this information and shall use the value of enhanced coverage restricted information to determine if enhanced coverage feature should be used or not. if the ue and the amf have negotiated to enable mico mode via mico indication and the amf uses the extended connected timer, then the amf provides the extended connected time value to ng - ran ( see clause 5. 31. 7. 3 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) in this step. the extended connected time value indicates the minimum time the ran should keep the ue in rrc _ connected state regardless of inactivity. for a ue using nr satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage, the amf may determine the extended connected timer value considering the unavailability period duration ( if available ), start of unavailability period ( if available ) as described in clause 5. 4. 13. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf indicates the ciot 5gs optimisations it supports and accepts in the supported network behaviour information ( see clause 5. 31. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) if the ue included preferred network behaviour in its registration request. the amf may steer the ue from 5gc by rejecting the registration request. the amf should take into account the preferred and supported network behaviour ( see clause 5. 31. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ) and availability of epc to the ue before steering the ue from 5gc. if the amf accepts mico mode as indicated in registration accept via mico indication and knows there may be mobile terminated data or signalling pending, the amf maintains the n2 connection for at least the extended connected time as described in clause 5. 31. 7. 3 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] and provides the extended connected time value to the ran. the amf includes service gap time if service gap time is present in the subscription information ( steps 14a - c ) or the service gap time has been updated by the subscriber data update notification to amf procedure ( see clause 4. 5. 1 ) and the ue has indicated ue service gap control capability. if the ue receives a service gap time in the registration accept message, the ue shall store this parameter and apply service gap control ( see clause 5. 31. 16 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ). if the network supports wus grouping ( see ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ), the amf shall send the wus assistance information to the ue. if the ue provided the ue paging probability information in step 1, the amf takes it into account to determine the wus assistance information. if the ue provided paging subgrouping support indication in step 1, a supporting amf may provide the amf peips assistance information, including the paging subgroup id as defined in ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. when the ue and the amf supports racs as defined in clause 5. 4. 4. 1a of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] and the amf needs to configure the ue with a ue radio capability id and the amf already has the ue radio capabilities other than nb - iot radio capabilities for the ue, the amf may provide the ue with the ue radio capability id for the ue radio capabilities the ucmf returns to the amf in a nucmf _ assign service operation for this ue. alternatively, when the ue and the amf support racs, the amf may provide the ue with an indication to delete any plmn - assigned ue radio capability id in this plmn ( see clause 5. 4. 4. 1a of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ). if the ue is \" cag supported \" and the amf needs to update the cag information of the ue, the amf may include the cag information as part of the mobility restrictions in the registration accept message. if the ue has indicated the support of unavailability period in the ue mm core network capability in the registration request, the amf shall indicate to the ue whether the corresponding feature is supported by providing the \" unavailability period support \" indication. if both the ue and the amf support the unavailability period, the amf may provide an unavailability period duration and / or start of unavailability period determined due to nr satellite access discontinuous coverage during initial registration procedure as described in clause 5. 4. 1. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has provided unavailability period duration and / or start of unavailability period in step 1, the amf shall store the received unavailability period duration and / or start of unavailability period in ue context. the amf considers that the ue is unavailable at the start of unavailability period as described in clause 5. 4. 1. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf may provide periodic registration update timer based on unavailability period duration and / or start of unavailability period indicated by the ue as described in clause 5. 4. 1. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the multi - usim ue has indicated support for one or more multi - usim specific capabilities in the ue 5gmm core network capability in step 1, the amf shall indicate to the multi - usim ue whether the corresponding one or more multi - usim specific features described in clause 5. 38 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] are supported, based on network capability and preference by the network ( i. e. based on local network policy ), by providing one or more of the connection release supported, paging cause indication for voice service supported, paging restriction supported and reject paging request supported indications. the amf shall only indicate paging restriction supported together with either connection release supported or reject paging request supported. the ue shall only use multi - usim specific features that the amf indicated as being supported. if the ng - ran provides mbsr indication in step 3 and the subscription data received in step 14 does not allow the mbsr operation, the amf may either accept the registration with providing the mbsr authorization information to mbsr ( iab - ue ), or the amf may reject the registration if the plmn does not allow the mbsr ( iab - ue ) to be registered to the plmn as specified in clause 5. 35a. 4 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue and amf supports disaster roaming service, the amf may include the \" list of plmn ( s ) to be used in disaster condition \", disaster roaming wait range information and disaster return wait range information as specified in ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if amf receives multiple tais from the ng - ran in step 3 and determines that some, but not all of them are forbidden by subscription or by operator policy, the amf shall include the forbidden tai ( s ) in the registration accept message. in the case of emergency registration, the amf shall not indicate support for any multi - usim specific features to the ue. if the ue has included support of equivalent snpns in step 1 and the serving snpn changes, the amf shall include the registered nid in the registration accept message as specified in ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. for a ue using nr satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage, the amf may provide return to coverage notification not required, which requests the ue in cm - idle state to not perform the mobility registration update procedure when it returns to coverage and / or provide the ue with a unavailability period duration and / or start of unavailability period ( if available ), as described in clause 5. 4. 13. 1 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. the amf may determine a maximum time offset and provide it to ue when it is allowed to initiate nas signalling with the network as described in clause 5. 4. 13. 5 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue has indicated the support of s - nssai location availability information, the amf may include s - nssai location availability information as described in clause 5. 15. 18 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. if the ue indicated a support for the network slice replacement feature in the 5gmm core network capability and the amf determines that an s - nssai from an allowed nssai is to be replaced with an alternative s - nssai ( as described in clause 5. 15. 19 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ), the amf includes the mapping of alternative nssai within the registration accept message to the ue and also adds the alternative s - nssai to the allowed nssai and / or configured nssai, if not already included. the mapping of alternative nssai is the mapping of each alternative s - nssai, included in the allowed nssai and / or configured nssai, to the corresponding replaced vplmn s - nssai or hplmn s - nssai ( as described in clause 5. 15. 19 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ). if the ue has indicated a support for reconnection to the network due to ran timing synchronization status in step 1 as described in ts 23. 501 [ 2 ], and if the amf received \" clock quality detail level \" either as part of an am policy association procedure or from the udm as part of clock quality reporting control information ( cqrci ) included in the access and mobility subscription data, \" ue reconnection indication \" is included in the registration accept message to the ue to inform the ue when to connect to the network in case when the ue later detects that the ng - ran timing synchronization status has changed while the ue is in rrc idle or rrc inactive state, as specified in clause 5. 27. 1. 12 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. 21b. [ optional ] the new amf performs a ue policy association establishment as defined in clause 4. 16. 11. for an emergency registration, this step is skipped. the new amf sends a npcf _ uepolicycontrol create request to pcf. pcf sends a npcf _ uepolicycontrol create response to the new amf. pcf triggers ue configuration update procedure as defined in clause 4. 2. 4. 3. 22. [ conditional ] ue to new amf : registration complete ( ). the ue sends a registration complete message to the amf when it has successfully updated itself after receiving any of the [ configured nssai for the serving plmn ], [ mapping of configured nssai ], [ nssrg information ], [ nsag information ] and a network slicing subscription change indication, or cag information in step 21. the ue sends a registration complete message to the amf to acknowledge if a new 5g - guti was assigned. if new 5g - guti was assigned, then the ue passes the new 5g - guti to its 3gpp access'lower layer when a lower layer ( either 3gpp access or non - 3gpp access ) indicates to the ue's rm layer that the registration complete message has been successfully transferred across the radio interface. note 13 : the above is needed because the ng - ran may use the rrc _ inactive state and a part of the 5g - guti is used to calculate the paging frame ( see ts 38. 304 [ 44 ] and ts 36. 304 [ 43 ] ). it is assumed that the registration complete is reliably delivered to the amf after the 5g - an has acknowledged its receipt to the ue. when the list of pdu sessions to be activated is not included in the registration request and the registration procedure was not initiated in cm - connected state, the amf releases the signalling connection with ue, according to clause 4. 2. 6. when the follow - on request is included in the registration request, the amf should not release the signalling connection after the completion of the registration procedure. if the amf is aware that some signalling is pending in the amf or between the ue and the 5gc, the amf should not release the signalling connection immediately after the completion of the registration procedure. if the ue has provided unavailability period duration and not included start of unavailability period in step 1, the amf shall release the signalling connection immediately after the completion of the registration procedure. if the ue has indicated start of unavailability period in step 1, the amf shall release the signalling connection before the start of unavailability period. if plmn - assigned ue radio capability id is included in step 21, the amf stores the plmn - assigned ue radio capability id in ue context if receiving registration complete message. if the amf provided updated slice deregistration timer value ( s ) to the ue in step 21, the amf uses the corresponding slice deregistration inactivity timer value ( s ) next time the slice deregistration inactivity timer ( s ) starts. if the ue receives plmn - assigned ue radio capability id deletion indication in step 21, the ue shall delete the plmn - assigned ue radio capability id ( s ) for this plmn. 23. [ conditional ] amf to udm : if the access and mobility subscription data provided by udm to amf in 14b includes steering of roaming information with an indication that the udm requests an acknowledgement of the reception of this information from the ue, the amf provides the ue acknowledgement to udm using nudm _ sdm _ info. for more details regarding the handling of steering of roaming information refer to ts 23. 122 [ 22 ]. 23a. for registration over 3gpp access, if the amf does not release the signalling connection, the amf sends the rrc inactive assistance information to the ng - ran. for registration over non - 3gpp access, if the ue is also in cm - connected state on 3gpp access, the amf sends the rrc inactive assistance information to the ng - ran. if the multi - usim ue has indicated support for the paging cause indication for voice service feature and the network supports the paging cause indication for voice service, the amf shall include an indication in the rrc inactive assistance information that the ue supports the paging cause indication for voice service to ng - ran to enable ng - ran to apply the paging cause indication for voice service feature for ran based paging. the amf also uses the nudm _ sdm _ info service operation to provide an acknowledgment to udm that the ue received cag information, or the network slicing subscription change indication ( see step 21 and step 22 ) and acted upon it. 24. [ conditional ] amf to udm : after step 14a and in parallel to any of the preceding steps, the amf shall send a \" homogeneous support of ims voice over ps sessions \" indication to the udm using nudm _ uecm _ update : if the amf has evaluated the support of ims voice over ps sessions, see clause 5. 16. 3. 2 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ] ; and if the amf determines that it needs to update the homogeneous support of ims voice over ps sessions, see clause 5. 16. 3. 3 of ts 23. 501 [ 2 ]. 25. [ conditional ] if the ue indicates its support for network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure in the ue mm core network capability in registration request and any s - nssai of the hplmn is subject to network slice - specific authentication and authorization, the related procedure is executed at this step ( see clause 4. 2. 9. 1 ). once the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure is completed for all s - nssais, the amf shall trigger a ue configuration update procedure to deliver an allowed nssai ( or partially allowed nssai ) containing also the s - nssais for which the network slice - specific authentication and authorization was successful and include any rejected nssais with an appropriate rejection cause value. the amf stores an indication in the ue context for any s - nssai of the hplmn subject to network slice - specific authentication and authorization for which the network slice - specific authentication and authorization succeeds. once completed the network slice - specific authentication and authorization procedure, if the amf determines that no s - nssai can be provided in the allowed nssai for the ue, which is already authenticated and authorized successfully by a plmn and if no default s - nssai ( s ) could be further considered, the amf shall execute the network - initiated deregistration procedure described in clause 4. 2. 2. 3. 3 and shall include in the explicit de - registration request message the list of rejected s - nssais, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value. if unavailability period duration is received from the ue and there is \" loss of connectivity \" monitoring event subscription for the ue, the amf triggers \" loss of connectivity \" monitoring event report and includes the remaining values of the unavailability period duration as described in clause 4. 15. the mobility related event notifications towards the nf consumers are triggered at the end of this procedure for cases as described in clause 4. 15. 4.\n",
