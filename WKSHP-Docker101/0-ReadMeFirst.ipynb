    "# Introduction to Docker 101\n",
    "In this workshop, we’ll go through the fundamentals of containers and Docker, from basic concepts up to running a full containerized web-based application. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Authors: [Bruno Cornec](mailto:bruno.cornec@hpe.com) & [Rene Ribaud](mailto:rene@flossita.org) & [Frederic Passeron](mailto:frederic.passeron@hpe.com)\n",

    "## Handouts\n",
    "You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). \n",
    "- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of the Docker Lab\n",
    "At the end of the lab, students should be able to install Docker, use the CLI to create a new image, create a container, launch an application in it, store data, and configure the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is intended to support a trial and error method so that, during the session, students should fully understand what is behind the tool. Blindly following instructions is not an effective way to learn, IMHO. You've been warned ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected duration : 120 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference documents\n",
    "When dealing with the installation and configuration of Docker, the first step  is to check the reference website http://docker.io/:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each section, there is an estimate of how long it will take to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab flow\n",
    "The {{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files, which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• A cell can be markdown or code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To run a cell, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running, it displays a [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy the labs ! :-)\n",
