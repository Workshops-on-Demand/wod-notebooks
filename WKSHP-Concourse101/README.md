# HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand

# Introduction to Concourse101 - An introduction to Concourse concepts
In this workshop we’ll go through some of the basics around Concourse. Built on the simple mechanics of resources, tasks, and jobs, Concourse presents a general approach to automation that makes it great for Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).
CI/CD embody a culture, set of operating principles, and collection of practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. The implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline.

## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
Workshop-on-Demand Workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series de cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)
