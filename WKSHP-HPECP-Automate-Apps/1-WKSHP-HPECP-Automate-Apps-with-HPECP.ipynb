    "\n",
    "1. As tenant user, you will first establish a valid login session with HPECP using the HPECP REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You will then fetch the Kubeconfig file for your tenant working context using the HPECP REST API.\n",
    ">Note: A kubeconfig file is used to access the Kubernetes cluster for your tenant working context\n",

    "**Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Cloud native application:* Also known as the 12 Factor app, a modern application that leverages microservices architecture with loosely coupled services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Non-cloud native application:* a multi-tier application with tightly coupled and interdependent services. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stateless application:* A stateless application is an application which does not require persistence of data nor an application state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stateful application:* A stateful application typically requires persistence of certain mountpoints across application cluster nodes rescheduling, restarts, upgrades, rollbacks. A stateful application can also need persistence of network identity (i.e.: hostname). \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Splunk Operator for Kubernets (SOK)* The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes (SOK) makes it easy for Splunk Administrators to deploy and operate Enterprise deployments in a Kubernetes infrastructure. Packaged as a container, it uses the operator pattern to manage Splunk-specific custom resources, following best practices to manage all the underlying Kubernetes objects for you."
