    "- *HPE Container Platform* is an enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications whether they are on-premises, at the edge, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model. This makes the HPE Container Platform ideal for helping enterprise customers accelerate their application development and deployment via **containers** on-demand through a self-service portal and a RESTful API that surfaces programmable access. To learn more about HPE Container Platform, visit the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com) and check out the blog articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *tenant:* A tenant is a group of users created by the platform administrator. A tenant can represent, for example, an office location, a business unit, an organization, or a project. A tenant is allocated a quota of resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and Kubernetes clusters resources) by the platform administrator. All the resources used by a tenant are not shared with other tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Working tenant context:* A working tenant context establishes the user identity, its tenant name and role (member or admin). Based on this context, tenant users are granted privileges and permissions to create and manage resources for their tenant on Kubernetes clusters managed by HPE CP."
